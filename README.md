# Car Repo Scraper
A scraper to find and notify when new cars are posted on repossession websites, using Selenium, GitHub Actions, and [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh). The script is ran once a day.

## Get Notified
If you want to get notified when a car is posted, you can download the [ntfy.sh mobile app](https://ntfy.sh/docs/subscribe/phone/) or use the [web app](https://ntfy.sh/app) and subscribe to **`utah-car-repos`** as the topic.

When a notification comes in, it'll show the car, current price, details (if available) and an image (if available; may have to download it from the notification). Tapping on the notification will launch your browser to view the car's listing.

## Current Repo Sites
Currently targets only repossession websites in Utah.
